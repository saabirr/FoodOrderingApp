# My Personal Project

## Food ordering application
Online food ordering apps are becoming more prevalent in today's market. It is therefore very important 
to improve constantly the quality of catering service they provide. My food ordering application
will manage the catalog of food options with easily manageable and reliable
application that will support both the serving staff and application users.

 *Objective of this application*

- manage food orders.
- manage available and out of order food items record.
- arrange the available menu in terms of relevant categories like vegetarian and seafood.

 *User Stories*
 
- As a user, I want to add a meal to my order list.
- As a user, I want to view the list of meals in a particular category by passing category name.
- As a user, I want to be able to delete a meal from my order list.
- As a user, I want to be able to see if a meal is available or out of order.
- As a user, I want to be able to save my Menu to file.
- As a user, I want to be able to be able to load my Menu  from file  and print to console.

*PHASE 4: Task 2:*

No events are logged when the program is initially run because the events are initiated by the user. For example the
program supports logging events when Xs is added Y and when an X is deleted from Y. an example of the logged events that
are printed to the console when a user adds two Xs to Y and deletes an X from Y is shown below:

Fri Apr 01 13:39:39 PDT 2022
A meal has been Added to the menu
Fri Apr 01 13:39:46 PDT 2022
A meal has been Added to the menu
Fri Apr 01 13:39:51 PDT 2022
A meal has been deleted from the menu




*PHASE4: Task 3*

The design presented in the UML diagram is fairly simple and cohesive mostly. I would however improve the readability of
my Gui class to improve readability and cohesiveness. The responsibilities I would assign to the classes I will design
will be for example:
_ making a class that handles user Keypad entries just like the AlarmSystem Application.
_ making a class the handles the saving and loading of menu from file.
